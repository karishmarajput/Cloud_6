<h1 align="center" id="title">Verifier: Blockchain based certificate generation and validation </h1>

<p id="description">The core purpose of the system is to provide a platform for diverse organizations to manage both certificate issuance and verification processes. The system will use this information to make certificates and send them to the recipients via email. While making each certificate a hash will be created using the certificate information and this hash will be stored blockchain with certificate ID and all the data is stored in database.The system relies on the certificate ID provided by the organizer. It uses this certificate ID to retrieve the unique hash stored in the blockchain (H1). Then it generates a hash using the uploaded certificate for verification (H2). These two hashes are compared to confirm the authenticity of the certificate.</p>
